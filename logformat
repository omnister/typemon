The log file is kept in ~/.typelog

When the program is started fresh, a line is added like

    02/28/97 19:50:37 [RESTART]  T = 00:00:00, M = 00:00:00, A = 00:00:00

The T field is typing time, the M field is mousing time, and the
A field is total activity time: either mousing or typing.  The A field
is not the simple sum of T & A because of overlap between the various
activities.

If the verbose (-v) option is enabled, then the command line
parameters are also echoed:

    #Options: -t20 -m80 -r10 -p5 -o1 /dev/ps2kbd /dev/ps2mouse
    02/28/97 19:50:37 [RESTART]  T = 00:00:00, M = 00:00:00, A = 00:00:00

If the program is killed during the day, and later restarted, it
is important to remember what the elapsed working time was, so a
line is generated so that typemon can initialize itself when restarted:

    02/24/97 19:49:48 [KILLED]  T = 00:00:08, M = 00:00:39, A = 00:00:39

At midnight of each day, a summary of the day's activity is printed
in the log:

    02/28/97 23:59:56 [Summary]  T = 00:36:54, M = 01:41:51, A = 01:54:06

After printing the summary, the internal time counters are zero'ed
to start the next day fresh.

I plan to extend this format with a line like:

    06/07/99 20:59:52 [QUESTION/1.0] 8:1/0 2:1/2 22:0/2

This gives the version of the question file (1.0), and then
a list of <questions>:<number_yes>/<number_no>.  So the example
above says that question 8 was asked only once in the day
and the answer was yes.  Question 2 was asked three times and answered
yes once.  Question 22 was asked twice and answered no both times.
