# This is the tm(1) "typemon" question file.

# Version 0.1 6/15/99, Rick Walker walker@opus.hpl.hp.com 1-857-3754
# 
#
# Format:
#
#   1. comments are introduced by a "#" sign in the first column.
#   2. Questions are delimited by completely blank lines. 
#   3. The first token of each line is a question identifier. This
#      will generally be a number followed by a right parenthesis ")".
#      The identifier is used to report question results in the
#      ~/.typelog logfile.  
#   4. If you add personal questions, please use numbers starting
#      at 100 or above (eg: "100)").  That way the HP Ergonomics
#      team can reliably combine logfiles to assess lab-wide
#      progress.
#   5. To enable a question (or several questions), simply remove
#      the comment character "#" from *all* lines of the question. It
#      is recommended that up to three questions be used at a time, and
#      that the questions be changed after they become habit and have
#      been answered "yes" for several weeks in a row.
